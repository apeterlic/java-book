 * Your task is to create a menu. Create a program that takes input from the user. When the user enters the “X”, the
 * program should terminate. If the user enters the word “first”, you should ask him to add two numbers and print their
 * sum. If the user enters the word “second”, then you should ask him to enter three numbers and calculate the average
 * value. If the user enters the word “third,” the program should ask the user to enter the additional string (sentence)
 * and transform it so that all words start with an uppercase letter. The rest of the letters should be in lowercase.
